I spent the day looking at a number of spreadsheets, but this set of data didn't just tell me about "productivity" or "bookings." It told me a story about the world's most vulnerable people.

I spent the day looking at a number of spreadsheets, but this set of data didn't just tell me about "productivity" or "bookings." It told me a story about the world's most vulnerable people.
Imagine a city the size of Tokyo and London combined. That is roughly 50 million people and every single one of them is currently living in modern slavery.
My analysis of the 2023 Global Slavery Index reveals that this isn't just a "faraway problem." It is woven into the very fabric of our global economy.


Key Observations
The G20 Connection: Wealthy nations aren't just observers; they are engines of this crisis. G20 countries import $468 billion worth of at-risk products annually, with electronics ($243.6B) and garments ($147.9B) leading the list.
A Rising Tide: The number of people in modern slavery has jumped by 10 million in just five years.
The "Prevalence vs. Volume" Trap: While countries like North Korea and Eritrea have the highest prevalence (rate per 1,000 people), countries like India (11M), China (5.8M), and Nigeria (1.6M) have the highest absolute numbers of people affected.
The Vulnerability Multiplier: Climate change and conflict are acting as "force multipliers". Forced migration due to environmental degradation is pushing millions straight into the hands of exploiters.


 Core Insights
The Transparency Deficit: Despite the rise in victims, government action in many wealthy nations has stagnated. We are seeing a "gap" where legislation exists (like in Australia or Norway), but enforcement hasn't kept pace with the complexity of global trade.
Hidden in Plain Sight: Modern slavery isn't just "unskilled" labor. It is increasingly present in the "Green Economy". The quartz and cobalt needed for our solar panels and EV batteries are high-risk sectors for forced labor.
Gendered Impact: This is a deeply gendered crisis. Over half of those in modern slavery are women and girls, often trapped in forced marriages or exploitative domestic work.


 Recommendations
For Businesses: Beyond "Check-the-Box" Compliance. Companies must move from simple audits to Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD). If your supply chain isn't transparent down to the raw material level, it’s at risk.
For Policy Makers: Close the Legislative Loopholes. We need mandatory reporting that carries real penalties for non-compliance. Anti-slavery measures must also be embedded into Climate Action Plans to protect those displaced by environmental shifts.
For the Data Community: We need better, more frequent national surveys. In many high-volume countries like India, the last major survey on bonded labor is decades old. You cannot fix what you do not measure.
